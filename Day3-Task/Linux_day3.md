# Day 3: Process Management & System Monitoring

## What You'll Learn Today
- How to manage running processes (start, stop, monitor)
- System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- Background process management
- Creating monitoring scripts
- System health checks

---

## TASK 1: Start and Manage Background Processes
**What you'll learn**: How to run processes in background (essential for servers!)

**Steps**:
1. Start a long-running process in background:
   ```bash
   sleep 300 &
   ```
2. Check background jobs:
   ```bash
   jobs
   ```
3. Start another background process:
   ```bash
   sleep 600 &
   ```
4. List all background jobs again:
   ```bash
   jobs
   ```
5. Bring first job to foreground:
   ```bash
   fg %1
   ```
6. Press Ctrl+Z to pause it, then put it back in background:
   ```bash
   bg %1
   ```

**Tell me**: 
- How many background jobs did you see?
2261 and 2384 
- What happened when you brought job to foreground?

üéØ Process Came to Foreground
The sleep 300 process moved from background to foreground
Terminal showed sleep 300 (indicating it's now the active process)
‚è∏Ô∏è Your Prompt Disappeared
No more user@cloudshell:~ $ prompt
Terminal was "busy" running the sleep command
You couldn't type new commands
üîí Terminal Became "Blocked"
The terminal was waiting for sleep 300 to finish
If you tried typing, nothing would happen
You were "stuck" until the process finished (or you interrupted it)

‚úã You Used Ctrl+Z to Regain Control
Ctrl+Z paused the sleep process

## TASK 2: Monitor System Processes
**What you'll learn**: How to see what's running on your system

**Steps**:
1. See all processes with resource usage:
   ```bash
   ps aux
   ```
2. Find processes using most CPU:
   ```bash
   ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10
   ```
3. Find processes using most memory:
   ```bash
   ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
   ```
4. Count total number of processes:
   ```bash
   ps aux | wc -l
   ```
  =47  
5. Find all processes containing "sleep":
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep sleep
   ```

   top
   ```
   (Press 'q' to quit)
2. Check system load average:
   ```bash
   uptime
   `
   =18:45:46 up  2:38,  0 user,  load average: 0.01, 0.12, 0.20
3. Monitor memory usage:
   ```bash
   free -h
   ```
   =total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7.8Gi       2.4Gi       4.1Gi       1.1Mi       1.5Gi       5.3Gi

2. Kill one process using PID (replace XXXX with actual PID):
   ```bash
   kill XXXX
   ```
   kill 676
3. Check if it's gone:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep sleep
   ```
   root           1  0.0  0.0   4324  2560 ?        Ss   17:57   0:00 /bin/bash /google/scripts/onrun.sh sleep infinity
root         448  0.0  0.0   2696  1152 ?        S    17:57   0:00 sleep infinity
kingwc2+    9435  0.0  0.0   6548  2304 pts/6    S+   18:55   0:00 grep --color=auto sleep
4. Force kill the remaining process:
   ```bash
   kill -9 YYYY
   ```
   (Replace YYYY with the PID)
5. Verify all sleep processes are gone:
   ```bash
   jobs
   ps aux | grep sleep
   ```

**Tell me**:
- Were you able to kill the processes? yes 
- What's the difference between `kill` and `kill -9`?
kill - Is normal Process else kill -9 - is terminated process force

## What You're Learning Today:

### Real DevOps Skills:
1. **Process Management** - Starting, stopping, monitoring processes
2. **Resource Monitoring** - CPU, memory, disk, network usage
3. **Automation** - Creating monitoring scripts
4. **Alerting** - Setting up basic performance alerts
5. **Troubleshooting** - Finding and managing problematic processes

### Why This Matters:
- **Production Systems**: Servers run hundreds of processes
- **Performance Issues**: You need to find resource-hungry processes
- **System Stability**: Monitoring prevents crashes
- **Automation**: Scripts reduce manual monitoring work
