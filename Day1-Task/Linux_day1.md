# Advanced Day 1 Tasks - DevOps Security & Automation

## ADVANCED TASK 1: File Permissions & Security
**What you'll learn**: How to secure files and directories (critical in production!)

**The Problem**: Your log files are readable by everyone on the system. In production, log files often contain sensitive information.

**Steps**:
1. Check current permissions: `ls -la /home/$USER/devops-learning/day1/logs/`
2. Make logs directory secure (only owner can access): `chmod 700 /home/$USER/devops-learning/day1/logs`
3. Make log files readable only by owner: `chmod 600 /home/$USER/devops-learning/day1/logs/*.log`
4. Verify changes: `ls -la /home/$USER/devops-learning/day1/logs/`
5. Check parent directory: `ls -la /home/$USER/devops-learning/day1/`

**Tell me**: 
- What permissions did the files have before? (like -rw-rw-r--)
- What permissions do they have after? 
- Can you explain the difference?

**Result**
-before permission -rw-rw-r--1  access.log
-after -rw --------1 access.log

i think after chmod user can't get easily or check this logs files if you have authorize or permission you can check these logs files that is major diffrences security and userbased logs.

## ADVANCED TASK 2: Process Monitoring & System Analysis
**What you'll learn**: How to monitor what's running on your system

**The Problem**: DevOps engineers need to know what processes are consuming resources.

**Steps**:
1. See all running processes: `ps aux`
2. Find processes using most CPU: `ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10`
3. Find processes using most memory: `ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10`
4. See real-time process activity: `top` (press 'q' to quit after 10 seconds)
5. Count total processes: `ps aux | wc -l`
6. Find processes related to SSH: `ps aux | grep ssh`

**Tell me**: 
- How many total processes are running?
-107
- Which process is using the most CPU?
root           1  0.0  1.5 167768 13144 ?        Ss   13:32   0:03 /sbin/init
- Which process is using the most memory?
root        2868  0.0  4.2 1700716 36708 ?       Ssl  13:54   0:00 /usr/lib/snapd/snapd
- Are there any SSH processes running?
i'm not found any ssh process maybe i don;t know how to check

## ADVANCED TASK 3: Create Your First Automation Script
**What you'll learn**: Write a script that automates system checks

**The Problem**: Manual system checking is time-consuming. DevOps engineers automate repetitive tasks.

**Steps**:
1. Create script directory: `mkdir -p /home/$USER/devops-learning/day1/scripts`
2. Create the script: `nano /home/$USER/devops-learning/day1/scripts/system_check.sh`
3. Copy this script content:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# System Health Check Script
# Created by: [Your Name]

echo "=== SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK ==="
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo ""

echo "=== DISK USAGE ==="
df -h | grep -E "(Filesystem|/dev/)"
echo ""

echo "=== MEMORY USAGE ==="
free -h
echo ""

echo "=== CPU LOAD ==="
uptime
echo ""

echo "=== TOP 5 CPU PROCESSES ==="
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -6
echo ""

echo "=== LOG FILES COUNT ==="
find /home/$USER -name "*.log" 2>/dev/null | wc -l
echo "Log files found in home directory"
echo ""

echo "=== SYSTEM CHECK COMPLETE ==="
```
4. Save and exit nano (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)
5. Make script executable: `chmod +x /home/$USER/devops-learning/day1/scripts/system_check.sh`
6. Run your script: `/home/$USER/devops-learning/day1/scripts/system_check.sh`

**Tell me**: 
- Did the script run successfully?
after - `/home/$USER/devops-learning/day1/scripts/system_check.sh` my system not do anything just like stuck even i trying to give commands like pwd ls -la not responces came -
hp@Mydevopsvm:~/devops-learning/day1/logs$ chmod +x /home/hp/devops-learning/day1/scripts/system_check.sh
hp@Mydevopsvm:~/devops-learning/day1/logs$ /home/hp/devops-learning/day1/scripts/system_check.sh
hp@Mydevopsvm:~/devops-learning/day1/logs$ 
hp@Mydevopsvm:~/devops-learning/day1/logs$ cd ..
hp@Mydevopsvm:~/devops-learning/day1$ cd ..
hp@Mydevopsvm:~/devops-learning$ cd ..
hp@Mydevopsvm:~$ /home/hp/devops-learning/day1/scripts/system_check.sh
hp@Mydevopsvm:~$ ls -la
hp@Mydevopsvm:~$ pwd

others answers i don't know
- What's your system's memory usage percentage?
- What's your system uptime?
- Copy-paste the "TOP 5 CPU PROCESSES" section

## Why These Advanced Tasks Matter:

### Task 1 - Security:
- **Production Reality**: Log files contain sensitive data (user info, errors, system details)
- **Security Best Practice**: Restrict file permissions to prevent unauthorized access
- **DevOps Skill**: Understanding Linux permissions is fundamental

### Task 2 - Monitoring:
- **Production Reality**: You need to identify resource-hungry processes
- **Troubleshooting**: High CPU/memory usage causes performance issues  
- **DevOps Skill**: Proactive monitoring prevents system crashes

### Task 3 - Automation:
- **Production Reality**: Manual checks don't scale to hundreds of servers
- **Efficiency**: One script replaces 10 manual commands
- **DevOps Skill**: Scripting is the foundation of automation

## Bonus Challenge (Optional):
If you complete all 3 tasks easily, try this:
- Modify the script to email you the results (we'll work on this together)
- Set up the script to run automatically every hour using cron
